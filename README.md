## Overview

This project is a React-based Instagram clone that allows users to sign up, log in, upload images, and view posts with comments.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Storage)
- Material-UI
- CSS

## Features

1. **Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up and log in securely using Firebase Authentication.
   - Logout functionality is available.

2. **Posts:**
   - Posts are displayed with usernames, captions, and images.
   - Posts are sorted by timestamp in descending order.

3. **Image Upload:**
   - Users can upload images along with captions.
   - Image uploads are stored in Firebase Storage.
   - Progress bar indicates upload status.

4. **Comments:**
   - Users can add comments to posts.
   - Comments are displayed with usernames and timestamps.

## Project Structure

- **App.js:** Main component handling overall app structure.
- **firebase.js:** Firebase configuration and initialization.
- **ImageUpload.js:** Component for image uploads.
- **Post.js:** Component rendering individual posts.
- **CSS files:** Styles for different components.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up Firebase project and update `firebaseConfig` in `firebase.js` with your credentials.
4. Run the app using `npm start`.

## Additional Notes

- **Modal Component:** Uses Material-UI's `Modal` for sign-up and sign-in forms.
- **Avatar Component:** Material-UI's `Avatar` is used for user avatars.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
